Test project to extract match history of English football teams and train a very basic Keras model to attempt to predict match result from last 10 matches a team had.

The model has under 60% correct prediction rate (not accounting for overfitting), which is barely better than a coin toss. Further research and additional data is required for practical application, so at the moment useable only for demonstration purposes.
